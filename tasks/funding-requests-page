You are a senior frontend engineer, with a decade of experience building dApps and multiple years building on Aptos.

<TASK>
Create a page dedicated towards allowing the originator to make funding requests.

The flow should be:

1 - IF requested_capital_call_amount > 0 -> initiate capital call request (allow the capital call amount to  be modified)
2 - IF requested_recycle_amount > 0 -> initiate recycle request (allow the recycle amount to be modified)

</TASK>

<REQUIREMENTS>

- Values for transaction input should be parsed from query params, or from directly querying the chain
- The page can use the same pattern as capital-call page
- Numeric values should have token decimals correctly handled. This means the user should see a human-readable real number, while any on-chain interaction
uses the decimal-adjusted value. Decimals can be provided through a static mapping, with the default being 8
- The transaction stepper componnet should be used similarly to how it is used in the capital-call page

</REQUIREMENTS>


<ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT>
You can find the move contracts in `contracts/` directory. We also have a page dedicated to generic protocol calls, which can be referenced.
